# zsh-themes
My very own ZSH themes, that I mostly use

For [Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) users 
1. Create the themes folder if you haven't already, `mkdir $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes`
2. `wget -O $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/luck.zsh-theme https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elli0t43/zsh-themes/main/luck.zsh-theme`
3. `nvim ~/.zshrc` or simply open this file in your favorite text editor,
